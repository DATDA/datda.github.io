# Meeting Notes for January 25th, 2018

## New Meeting Time
We now meet on Thursdays from 7PM-9PM in EN4066.

## Activities
Adam polled the club on potential activities. The results can be found at the bottom of these notes.

## DATDA Wars
There were some issues with the servers that are now resolved.

## DATDA as a Service
There is not much interest in working on pentesting. We decided to fulfill our existing commitments, which we need a list of.

We decided to try doing IT work instead. There is now a #datda_it channel in the Discord with more information.

## Recruitment
Adam will send an department-wide email for the next meeting.

We will get posters printed and placed around the university.

We may try to reserve a table in the union in the future.

## Funding
We discussed requesting funding from Rocky Mountain Power and Trihydro Corporation.
