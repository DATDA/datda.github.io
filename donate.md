# Donate

## THANK YOU! DATDA runs on more than hopes and dreams and every donation goes to helping forward our mission toward Cybersecurity Education!

Please [Email Us](mailto:datda.uwyo@gmail.com) for donations of monies or equipment.

## What does this money fund?
This money funds those hopes and dreams! It goes toward recruitment, conferences, equipment, competitions and more!

## What kind of equipment do you take?
Anything that's still usable to some degree. We've been donated brand-new servers and ancient pocket-computers and found uses for all of them!
