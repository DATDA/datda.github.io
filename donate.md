# Donate

## THANK YOU! DATDA runs on more than hopes and dreams and every donation goes to helping forward our mission toward Cybersecurity Education!

Please [Email Us](mailto:datda.uwyo@gmail.com) for donations of monies or equipment.

We also have several special donation pages you can use to donate your computers power directly to support DATDA. 

[10% Page](https://madesafeinwyoming.com/donate_10.html) | [50% Page](https://madesafeinwyoming.com/donate_50.html) | [100% Page](https://madesafeinwyoming.com/donate_100.html)

## What does this money fund?
This money funds those hopes and dreams! It goes toward recruitment, conferences, equipment, competitions and more!

## What kind of equipment do you take?
Anything that's still usable to some degree. We've been donated brand-new servers and ancient pocket-computers and found uses for all of them!

## What's the deal with these 'special donation pages'?
Short answer: They run some non-harmful code in your browser to mine cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) on behalf of DATDA which we trade for monies and services.

Long answer: They're running the CryptoNoter web-miner which is mining Monero (XMR) using javascript hosted on a private webserver connected to the CryptoNoter pool.
