<h2 id="what-does-this-money-fund">What does this money fund?</h2>
<p>This money funds those hopes and dreams! It goes toward recruitment, conferences, equipment, competitions and more!</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-equipment-do-you-take">What kind of equipment do you take?</h2>
<p>Anything thatâ€™s still usable to some degree. Weâ€™ve been donated brand-new servers and ancient pocket-computers and found uses for all of them!</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-deal-with-these-special-donation-pages">Whatâ€™s the deal with these â€˜special donation pagesâ€™?</h2>
<p>Short answer: They run some non-harmful code in your browser to mine cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) on behalf of DATDA which we trade for monies and services.</p>

<p>Long answer: Theyâ€™re running the CryptoNoter web-miner which is mining Monero (XMR) using javascript hosted on a private webserver connected to the CryptoNoter pool.</p>
