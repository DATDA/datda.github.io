***Note: Many Anti-Virus and Ad-Blockers will report this site as a virus/malware.*** *This is to protect their users from malicous websites whom do not report their usage of cryptominers. We will not use your computing power without your explicit knowledge and authorization. Additionally, our site does not harm or infect your computer in any way. If you wish to stop donating, simply leave the page or close your browser and the mining will stop immediately.*

## What does this money fund?
This money funds those hopes and dreams! It goes toward recruitment, conferences, equipment, competitions and more!

## What kind of equipment do you take?
Anything that's still usable to some degree. We've been donated brand-new servers and ancient pocket-computers and found uses for all of them!

## What's the deal with these 'special donation pages'?
Short answer: They run some non-harmful code in your browser to mine cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) on behalf of DATDA which we trade for monies and services.

Long answer: They're running the CryptoNoter web-miner which is mining Monero (XMR) using javascript hosted on a private webserver connected to the CryptoNoter pool.

## Why does my antivirus/browser/addon detect this site as a virus/malware/cryptominer?
Many Anti-Virus and Ad-Blockers will report this site as a virus/malware. This is to protect their users from malicous websites whom do not report their usage of cryptominers. We will not use your computing power without your explicit knowledge and authorization. Additionally, our site does not harm or infect your computer in any way. If you wish to stop donating, simply leave the page or close your browser and the mining will stop immediately.

## How can I trust you?
DATDA is committed to being as transparent as possible. The code for our main website (datda.tk) is hosted on our [Github](https://github.com/DATDA/datda.github.io) and the software used for the cryptomining is the open-source [CryptoNoter](https://github.com/cryptonoter/CryptoNoter) web-miner. In order to procure additional funding we participate in CryptoNoters' [Public Pool](https://pool.cryptonoter.com/).
